# CSC3350 Project 1
## Processes
### Overview
This project can be implemented using either C# or C/C++. Upload your source code and documentation file to Canvas->Assignments. Using a Word document, describe the operation of the program.
### Implementation 
Implement a console-based application. Your task is to implement a program that starts a second program. The main program should compute the execution time of the second program. The second programâ€™s implementation is  up to you.
### The Program
I wrote a Go program that reads in a integer from the console. Then from there it marks the time right before the second program will start. Then once the process ends it prints the duration in seconds. The second program is a python script that solves for how many primes there are up to n values.
